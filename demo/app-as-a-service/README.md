# Demo: App as a Service

This Promise provides an App-as-a-Service. This is a compound Promise that installs the following Promises:

- [Nginx-ingress](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/tree/main/nginx-ingress)
- [Postgres](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/tree/main/postgresql)
- [Redis](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/tree/main/redis)
- [Slack](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/tree/main/slack)
- [Deployment](../deployment/) (which deploys the sample application to the Worker Cluster with the configured ingress)

The following fields are configurable:

- name: application name
- image: application image
- dbDriver: db type, only postgresql or none are valid options currently
- region: multi-cluster region, not currently supported


To install:
```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix/main/demo/app-as-a-service/promise.yaml
```

To make a resource request:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix/main/demo/app-as-a-service/resource-request.yaml
```

This resource request deploys the Kratix [sample Golang app](https://github.com/syntasso/sample-golang-app).

To test the sample app once it is successfully deployed, port forward with command
below and access at `http://localhost:8080`, ensure you have the
`Host: todo.example.com` set in your browser:
```
kubectl --context kind-worker port-forward svc/nginx-nginx-ingress 8080:80
```

## Development
